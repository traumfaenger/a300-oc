# a300-oc
This is a community-effort to be able to run X300 BIOS on the A300 or at least be able to restore O/C functions from earlier A300 BIOS Version for A300.

This repository contains findings and images (maybe in future also patched versions)
There should be a small Wiki with read-ups for new members of the project to find
according information.

Currently: \
-A300 3.60S is AGESAv2, no overclock possible \
-A300 3.60R is AGESAv2, last version o/c possible
